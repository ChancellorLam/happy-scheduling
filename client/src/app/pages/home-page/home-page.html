    <h2>About This Calculator</h2>
    <p>
      This calculator takes a group of candidates' rankings of how well each time slot works for them and assigns each
      candidate to a time slots in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. It ensures that every candidate is
      scheduled for exactly one slot and that no slot is overbooked. Behind the scenes, the tool uses linear programming
      and mathematical optimization to carefully balance everyoneâ€™s preferences to create the most optimal schedule for
      the entire group.
